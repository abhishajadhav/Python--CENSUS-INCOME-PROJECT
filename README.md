# Python--CENSUS-INCOME-PROJECT

The task is to predict the income bracket of an individual, specifically whether they earn more than $50,000 a year or less, using machine learning algorithms. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and building predictive models.

Tasks Performed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Analyzed the dataset to uncover key insights about various features. 
Visualized distributions and relationships between features like Age Distribution and Income Distribution.

Data Preprocessing:
Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Scaled numeric values where necessary.

Machine Learning Models Performed:
Built Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifiers.
Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy of 86%.

Key Results
Best Model: Random Forest with 86% accuracy.
